# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

![Design preview for the Social links profile coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my submission for the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge which help me brush up my front-end skills by building realistic projects. It took me approximately 2 hours to complete the challenge. This is the live URL for the challenge : [Social Media Page](https://anniechakraborty.github.io/social-links-profile-main/)

The webpage is mobile responsive and I will be working on it to personalize it further and add some animations.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We can use any tools we like to help us complete the challenge.

The users should be able to:
